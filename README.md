# Terraform and load_balancer
The following is my project on terraform and AWS CLI.
Terraform is a one stop solution for scalability of cloud architecture, it can handle multiple cloud clients and talk to them on your behalf giving you a clean and universal syntax
The following are the files and its functionality:
1. Terraform.tf - Enlists the resource blocks, vpc, ingress egress details, aws user id passwrods etc.
2. Terraform.tfvars - Enlists the variables you wish to use ex: instance_types = ['t2.medium' ,'m6g.4xlarge']
3. instance_details.json - lists the already running instance_details
4. Cpu_util.json - file generated by AWS CLI for knowing the instance cpu utilization so that the load_balancer can function accordingly
5. reset.py - resets everything in case of a bug, saves a lot of debugging time
6. Load_balancer.py - Main code for creating, terminating, listing docker processes, fetchin cpuutil.
